                        Shalom, In our congregation slum village house have no proper houses and roofs. During rainy season they are facing a lot of problems, they
                        don't have proper sleep at times during that season.They hold the babies ( months old mostly) on their shoulders and they will stand throughout 
                        the night of rain due to wet floor and no proper roof and shelter. we will visit and share the love of christ, we will distribute the carpets,
                        which in turn they use them as roofs. Praise God.
