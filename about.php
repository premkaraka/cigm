                            To break the cycle of Poverty by providing holistic development to impoverish orphans and communications in India, through meeting
                            their physical , educational, spirtual and socail needs. To change and equip children to live productive and responsible lives.
                            The Gracious children ministries is a multi faceted ministry, addressing poverty stricken orgpans and communities through multiple initiatives.
                            Primarily, this project benefits orphaned, abandoned and abused children, while offering programs and services to the community. By 
                            taking the poores and most disadvanataged segment of society and giving them the love , care and an enivronment to achieve excellence, a significant
                            impact is being made.As we raise these children with elevated standards and expectations, they become the top segment of the same society
                            form which they came.
                            No one has yet fully realized the wealth of sympathy , kindness and generosity hidden in the soul of a child. The effort of every true education should be to 
                            unlock that treasure.

                            The Beginning of Gracious children's home actually started with gospel prayer ministries outreaches to the remote villages surrounding yeleswaram. 
                            we are going door to door slum villages and seeing many people coming to the Lord. we praised the lord a lot about that! we encouraged them to attend our church
                            and they were so happy . when we asked them about their lives, they explained to us about every thing.They would share about their situations and 
                            give testimonies daily when we visited them .
                        </p><br>
                    <p class="lead">
                      
                            some shared how , in order to sustain their families, they had to collect things to sell from the garbage.
                            In an effort to support their familes , they would also take their children with them and find them jobs as child laborers at rice mills and
                            factories. Sometimes they spent days starving, having no food at all. we are prayerfully distributing rice, cooking oils and dal in the tribal
                            slum people villages and some tribal villages have no pure waterm we many children are suffering health diseases due to impure water.
                            we will establish a pure water bore wells in some villages, here me and my mother daily work and feed our orphanage children.
                            please pray for our children.

                    <p class="lead">
                      we saw these situtations and felt so sorry and we prayed for them, but we did not know what we could do to help .as we
                            prayed each day for god to help these people,he spoke to us about it through his word in James. </p> <br>


                    <li class="text-primary lead fa fa-caret-square-o-down text-center"> "Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to 
                        keep oneself from being polluted by the world." James 1:27 </li>

                    <p class="lead ">
                      we began to pray a lot for God to help us to establish a home for those children who were orphaned or abandoned or whose parenrs did not have 
                            the means to care for them.Some people in the village supported us and encouraged us to start this precious ministry. we knew  we could
                            not do it without God's provision.God Strengthened and encouraged us and we were led to beging with only 5 girls children in the year 2008.
                            we just kept our hopes and trust in God only. God Spoke to my Mother Eswari, that the borders of our ministry were going to expand in miraculous
                            ways.</p> <br>

                    <p class="lead">
                        When we started Gracious Children's home in 2008, many people were so happy and praised God a lot.Even so, others did not like our idea.
                            It has not always been easy to provide sufficent meals for the children.we faced many problems,not the least of which were a lack of food
                            and being criticized for what er were trying to do.It was very difficult in those days.Yet we knew that God had called us to do this and that 
                            he was able to provide for us.we put faith in Him in every way for our ministry. He called us to do this so we knew that he would equip us!
                     
                    </p><br>
                    <p class="lead ">
                        since that time, we have been able to bring a total of 26 children to gracious children home.The first girl we brought, Navya, has passed
                            her exams and moved on to a Tailoring Training Programs.God has been so faithful to us  in every situation.

                            Now our Gracious children Home is being shaped in wonderful ways with some goood facilities. we do have more needs but we know that
                            we can trust god to meet them at the right time.</p> <br>

                    <p class="lead">
                          we thank God that we now have many children who are getting good food and being educated,but more than that, they are growing in faith.our 
                            hope is that our children would have such faith that it will let them forget what situations they are in and just praise God! our vision 
                            is to make gracious Children's home a good place that always shows the Love of Christ. </p> <br>
